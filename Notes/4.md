## 综述，这个是分方法的，还挺好
- Generally speaking, news content is often represented by using vector space model (e.g., Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)[8]), or topic distributions obtained by language models (e.g., Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI)[9] and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)[10]), and speciﬁc similarity measurements are adopted to evaluate the relatedness between news articles. A representative example of such systems involves News Dude[11], a personal news recommending agent that utilizes TF-IDF combined with the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to recommend news itemstoindividualusers. Anothercontent-basedexample is YourNews[12], which intends to increase the transparency of adapted news delivery by allowing the given user to adapt his/her proﬁle information. 

## 模型
- 对新闻内容分类
  - LSH + hierarchical clustering
    - hierarchical clustering provides us an elegant global representation of the latent structure of news corpus, which is helpful to the subsequent procedures
  - 直接对新闻集用kmeans或者hierarchical clustering太慢
